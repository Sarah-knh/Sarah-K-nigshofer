Verse 1)
You tore apart my dreams, left me in the dark,
Said you cared, but you left a lasting mark.
Now I'm stronger, rising from the pain,
I'll make sure you remember my name.

(Pre-Chorus)
You thought you'd leave me broken, lost in despair,
But watch me rise up, I'm free from your snare.
You thought you'd see me crumble, on the ground so weak,
But I found my voice, and now I'll speak.

(Chorus)
This is my vengeance, a tale untold,
From the ashes of heartbreak, I'll turn to gold.
You won't see me falter, won't see me cry,
I'll spread my wings and learn to fly.

(Verse 2)
Every lie you told me, now echoes in my mind,
Promises you made, you left them all behind.
I'll build a new tomorrow, from the ruins of today,
Your memory fades, as I find my way.

(Pre-Chorus)
You thought you'd leave me broken, lost in despair,
But watch me rise up, I'm free from your snare.
You thought you'd see me crumble, on the ground so weak,
But I found my voice, and now I'll speak.

(Chorus)
This is my vengeance, a tale untold,
From the ashes of heartbreak, I'll turn to gold.
You won't see me falter, won't see me cry,
I'll spread my wings and learn to fly.

(Bridge)
Now I'm stronger, wiser, with lessons learned,
Your betrayal, my strength, from the fire I burned.
I'll move on, unbroken, with my head held high,
In this story of revenge, I'll touch the sky.

(Chorus)
This is my vengeance, a tale untold,
From the ashes of heartbreak, I'll turn to gold.
You won't see me falter, won't see me cry,
I'll spread my wings and learn to fly.

(Outro)
So here's to my future, brighter than the past,
Your shadow can't touch me, I've found peace at last.
In this song of vengeance, I've found my way,
I'll face tomorrow, stronger every day.
